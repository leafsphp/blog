<p>Last month we co-hosted the Build First Conference. We used this platform to talk about Leaf, what it is, why you should use it and how to build simple but powerful applications and APIs using Leaf PHP. The event which was co-hosted with SeevCash was a huge success, and this is our recap for those who missed the event.</p>

## What is Build First?

Build First is a conference that aims to bring together developers, designers, entrepreneurs and product managers to share knowledge, talk and network. The conference is a one-day event that is held in Accra, Ghana. It is a platform for developers to learn, share, and get inspired.

The Leaf PHP team had the opportunity to co-host the event and talk about Leaf and we were excited to share our knowledge with the community. We talked about Leaf PHP, what it is, why you should use it and how to build simple but powerful applications and APIs using Leaf PHP. We also talked about the Leaf PHP ecosystem and how you can use it to build your next project.

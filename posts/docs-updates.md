## 5 Year Old Docs

Although the Leaf docs were originally written in a beginner-friendly way, it was not very detailed. The docs were also not very organized and it was hard to find what you were looking for. The whole point of the "5 Year Old Docs" was to make it easier for beginners to get started with Leaf.

The thought process was that a 5 year old should be able to read the docs and understand what Leaf is and how to use it. The docs were also written in a way that made it easy for beginners to understand the concepts and terminology. We included a lot of examples and videos from the following industry experts to help beginners get started:

- [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/)
- [TechWorld with Nana](https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/)
- [Linux Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClGShptNEuvTWGAAfpa2Etw)
- [Danielle Th√©](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQ0v3Q5_UCLQkp8AwHDNAA)
- [Mosh Hamedani](https://codewithmosh.com/)
- [Codecourse](https://codecourse.com/)
- [Traversy media](https://www.traversymedia.com/)
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

Throughout the docs you will find a bunch of links like this:

## MVC Docs

The Leaf MVC, Leaf API and Skeleton docs have been merged into the Leaf docs. The Leaf docs now include a section for Leaf MVC, Leaf API and Skeleton together with all the tools and techniques related to them. Leaf MVC, Leaf API and Skeleton originally had their own docs but they were not very detailed, they were unorganized and not actively maintained.

To fix this, we merged the documentation for everything MVC related into the main Leaf documentation. This makes it easier for beginners to get started with Leaf and any MVC build. In addition to this, finding information on features to use with Leaf's MVC tools is now easier because everything is in one place.

For beginners, the Leaf documentation explains what MVC is, the different MVC builds Leaf provides, their differences, and how to get started with them. For advanced users, the Leaf documentation explains how to use Leaf's MVC tools in various ways and use-cases. The aim is to make it easier for beginners to get started with Leaf and advanced users to get the most out of Leaf's MVC tools.

Everything MVC related can now be found under the "MVC INTEGRATIONS" section of the Leaf docs on the sidebar.
